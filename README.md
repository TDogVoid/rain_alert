This was a quick little project I created to let me know if it was going to rain outside in a few mins. Without installing an battery hungry app with tons of other alerts. 

Checks every 30 mins if its going to rain within the hour at config location.  If it is send a pushover alert.  Just configure secret.exs before building.

add a GITLAB variable to gitlab runner doesn't matter the value. This is to prevent it from looking for the secret file. While getting ready for build/deployment
